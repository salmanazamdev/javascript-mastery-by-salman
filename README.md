# 🚀 JavaScript Mastery by Salman

Welcome to my personal JavaScript practice repository! This is where I’m documenting my learning journey from **basics to advanced** ....> one `.js` file at a time. Every file in this repo contains my **practice questions**, **self-written solutions**, and **mini experiments** that I run using `Node.js`.

---

## 📌 Why This Repo?

I'm building a **strong foundation in JavaScript**, not just watching tutorials but actively solving things, making mistakes, fixing bugs, and growing like a real developer.

Each file you see here represents a section I’ve learned, broken down with real-world examples and clean comments.

## 📁 File Structure

> No folders yet : just simple, clean `.js` files for now:

| File | Topics Covered |
|------|----------------|
| `01-variables.js` | `let`, `const`, reassigning, types |
| `02-data-types.js` | `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `typeof` |
| `03-basic-operators.js` | arithmetic, comparison, assignment, logical ops |
| `04-conditions.js` | `if`, `else`, `else if`, truthy/falsy checks |
| `05-functions.js` | declarations, expressions, parameters, return |
| ...more coming soon |

Each file has:
- ✍️ Scenarios/questions at the top as comments
- ✅ Solutions below with console outputs
- 💡 Extra mini challenges sometimes

---

## 🧪 How to Run

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.  
To run any file, just:

```bash
node 01-variables.js
````

I write all files to be **terminal-friendly**, with `console.log()` used to test and display results.

## 🌱 Future Plans

* Move into DOM manipulation and browser JS
* Start making mini-projects
* Add folders for ES6+, async/await, APIs, etc.
* Build a personal **JavaScript Cheatsheet** based on this repo
